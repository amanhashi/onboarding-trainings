Mini Project Idea: Go Contact Manager (CLI)
A basic command-line Contact Manager that allows you to:

Add new contacts

List all contacts

Search for a contact by name

This small project includes:

Structs for contact data

Functions for handling logic

Maps & slices for data storage

Pointers to modify data

Interfaces & generics

Packages (split into files/folders if needed)

Arrays (for static demo)

Go basics & syntax usage

Mini Project Summary â€“ Go Contact Manager (CLI)


As part of consolidating my Go learnings, I built a small command-line Contact Manager in Go. The project demonstrates my understanding of core Go concepts including:

Structs & Custom Types for contact modeling

Functions, Arrays, Slices, and Maps for operations

Interfaces and Generics for extensibility

Use of Pointers for modifying contact data

Package and modular code design

Usage of standard Go syntax and CLI input/output

This helped reinforce both foundational and advanced topics in a practical context.
